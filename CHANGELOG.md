## [1.0.2] - 2016-09-22
### Added
- Specify a mega menu using a CSS class: `mega-menu-{post_id}` where {post_id} is the ID of the mega menu. To find the ID, look at the URL when editing the mega menu. This can be used as a workaround to pages that have special characters in the title and don't work the standard way.
